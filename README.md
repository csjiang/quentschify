# Quentschify 

## A tiny little React client-side app made as a birthday gift for my friend Daniel. 

- Increases the festiveness of any random text entered 
- Autofills text with hipster ipsum thanks to [HipsterJesus API](http://hipsterjesus.com/) 
- Once text is transformed, read aloud in one of 60+ voices thanks to the [SpeechSynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis)
